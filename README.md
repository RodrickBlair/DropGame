****IMPORTANT TASKS****

Make_sale.html must be a dynamic form, I already started working on it 
but I am having issues with the Jquery. I wanted to prepend the new row to the previous one. but it wont work.

**For the database**
in views.py at the make_sale function...

Insert as many data created from the ticket form into the database.

vendor, draw_date, draw_time, ticket_number must be inserted automatically.

**Explanation below**

vendor - Insert the name of the active login user.

ticket_number - Should but unique for all number created for a ticket.

draw_time - A choice is auto inserted base of the hour of the day.

draw_time is already autonow -- Already Done.
